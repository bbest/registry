_The registration of the IOOS services is a process that allows the wide range of various clients to efficiently discover U.S. IOOS data._

_Currently, all U.S. IOOS DMAC services must be registered with the [Service Registry ("Registry")](https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/docucomp/collectionSource/list?&layout=fluid), which is hosted and operated by the NGDC. The IOOS Service registry location and required procedures may change in the future; in such case, the Registration Process Guidelines will be updated accordingly_
